## What's Good-Loop?
At Good-Loop, we raise money for charities using the power of advertising.
Every time you watch one of our ads, we'll use the advertisers' money to make a donation to a charity of your choice.

Interested in hosting Ads For Good on your blog or website? Let us know.

Time and attention online are valuable.
Let's harness that value and use it for good.
Good-Loop will never force you to engage with an ad. But, if you choose to give an advertiser some of your valuable time and attention, you get to give 50% of the advertisers' money to a relevant charitable cause.
