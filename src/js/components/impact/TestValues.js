    "recommendation": "**WaterAid UK is rated as More Information Needed (promising) on the SoGive ratings scale.**\n\nWaterAid UK aims to transform lives by improving access to safe water, hygiene, and sanitation.\n\nUnder the SoGive [two question method](http://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2019/08/the-sogive-approach-to-assessing.html), we consider two questions:\n- how much does it cost for the charity to do something\n- what is the thing (or what does the beneficiary get for the donor's money)\n\n**More about what WaterAid does**\n\nWaterAid is an international non-profit organization that was set up in 1981. As of 2020, WaterAid provides services to [28](https://www.wateraid.org/where-we-work) low- and middle-income countries worldwide, and the charity has fundraising offices located in Australia, Japan, Sweden, India, the United Kingdom, and the United States. However, for WaterAid as a global movement, the vast majority of funding comes from just WaterAid UK. WaterAid UK’s income accounts for £91 million out of £112 million of global funding ([UK Annual Report](https://www.wateraid.org/uk/our-annual-reports) p. 62; [Global Annual Report](https://www.wateraid.org/sites/g/files/jkxoof271/files/global-annual-report-2019-20_0.pdf) p. 18). Around £80 million out of this £91 million was spent on the 18 countries within WaterAid UK’s areas of focus, but another £11 million was spent on supporting other WaterAid organizations to help the 10 other countries (UK Annual Report p. 62, 9; overheads included in all calculations in this analysis). In 2020, WaterAid UK’s total expenditure was £95.05 million  (UK Annual Report p. 62). \n\nWaterAid UK’s activities involve providing people with clean water, safe sanitation, and hygiene education. Direct delivery of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) accounts for about 42% of the total expenditure. According to the charity’s annual report, WaterAid UK funded 6,565,287 WASH interventions in one year (UK Annual Report p. 11).These interventions include providing a person with clean water (22% of interventions), giving someone a decent toilet (29% of interventions), and other methods that improve hygiene like providing soaps (51% of interventions) (UK Annual Report p. 11). The beneficiaries included people from communities (43% of interventions), children and teachers in schools (11% of interventions), and patients at healthcare facilities (46% of interventions) (Annual Report p. 11). It is possible that a single person receives multiple interventions. The impacts of these interventions may be significant, as diarrhea killed about [1.6 million people](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(18)30362-1) around the world in 2016. It is not clear to what extent the charity collaborates with other organisations, such as the Tanzanian Government (Annual Report p. 11). \n\nWaterAid UK also spent 37% of their total expenditure delivering WASH through \"sector strengthening and capacity building\" (UK Annual Report p. 62). In contrast to direct delivery, such indirect delivery aims to promote WASH by advising local authorities to improve planning, coordination, performance monitoring, technical implementation, citizens’ engagement, and financing models (UK Annual Report p. 14). The charity’s annual report shows many instances in which locals implemented better WASH policies under the guidance of WaterAid UK. For example, in Nepal the charity trained local technicians to fix leaks and improve water quality (UK Annual Report p. 16). However, the charity does not provide any quantitative information about the long-run benefits of improvements in locals’ capability to deliver WASH. Furthermore, the charity is collaborating with other organisations like Anglian Water (as with the work that took place in Nepal) in helping local communities to build capacity, so it is possible the situation would have improved even if WaterAid UK was not involved (UK Annual Report p. 16).\n\nWaterAid UK spent 16% of their total expenditure on \"influencing policy in water, sanitation and hygiene\" (UK Annual Report p. 62). In contrast to direct service and capacity building, such policy influence aims to encourage local authorities to prioritize WASH. This work can take the form of promoting higher standards for water safety, running a social media campaign on the plight of sanitation workers, and giving awards to Ugandan landlords who take water safety seriously (UK Annual Report p. 20-21). The charity’s annual report does not contain a breakdown of spending by different campaign projects. It also does not reveal information on the number of people who could eventually be helped by such campaigns. Furthermore, the charity is collaborating with other organisations like Action Against Hunger, and the annual report does not reveal any information about the extent to which WaterAid UK itself accelerates progress in Water Safety. To learn more about how SoGive approaches campaigns, see [this blog post](http://thinkingaboutcharity.blogspot.com/2021/04/sogive-three-question-method-for.html?view=sidebar).\n\nFinally, the charity spent about 5% of their total expenditure on supporting WaterAid’s branches in Australia, Japan, Sweden, India, and the United States, so that WaterAid branches in these countries can better support the 18 countries that WaterAid UK is not focusing on.\n\n**Cost-effectiveness analysis**\n\nAfter a review of the work of WaterAid under the two-question method, the next step in the SoGive process involves comparing this charity to SoGive’s Gold-standard for charity cost-effectiveness. To receive a firm Gold ranking, a charity has to achieve a high impact per pound donated (such as saving a life for £5,000, £50 to double someone’s consumption (spending) for one year, or £200 to avert one year of severe depression) and also provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of their work.\n\nGiven the above information of the cost per beneficiary in direct provision of WASH, it costs WaterAid UK on average approximately £6 to provide one treatment of clean water or sanitation. This cost per beneficiary means that £5,000 given to WaterAid UK would theoretically provide more than 800 people with clean water or hygiene. The same £5,000 given to a Gold-rated organisation would be expected to achieve a result as good as saving 1 human life. We should note that the estimate of £6 per treatment is certainly an underestimate of the actual cost and potentially a very large one. This is because WaterAid UK has 260 partner organisations (UK Annual Report p. 9), and it is unclear what percentage of the necessary charitable funds these other organisations account for. To illustrate this, it may be the case that it costs £1,000,000 to deliver clean sanitation to a village of 1,000 people in Ethiopia. If WaterAid accounts for £500,000 and a partner organisation in Ethiopia accounts for the rest, then WaterAid would appear twice as cost-effective as it actually is, given that it would only contribute half of the money. \n\nFurthermore, the annual report provides no indication of the degree of impact a WASH treatment can have on an individual. However, there is evidence that some of the charity’s interventions can be extremely impactful and relatively low in cost. The interventions can potentially save lives as hundreds of thousands of children die from diarrhea every year. WaterAid, at least at one point in the past, has used spring protection as one of its methods to ensure water safety, and a randomised controlled trial in Kenya has shown that such a method can achieve an outcome as good as saving a life for about [400 pounds](https://blog.givewell.org/2010/06/15/new-evidence-that-cleaner-water-less-diarrhea/). This appears far above SoGive’s gold standard. However, the annual report provides no evidence that the average impact of WaterAid’s interventions are comparable to spring protection. It is also worth noting that [GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org/international/charities/deprioritized-organizations), another charity evaluator that SoGive are admirers of, considered WaterAid but ultimately decided not to include them as one of their recommended charities.\n\nTo provide a concrete rating for WaterAid UK, we would need to know more about the impact of a typical direct intervention, such as the average improvement in health outcomes. We would also need more information about the impact the charity had through its indirect interventions and awareness campaigns.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the above, we rate WaterAid UK as More Information Needed (Promising) under the SoGive methodology. This means:\n- We do not have (or, occasionally, have not been able to verify) good evidence that the charity’s work is effective\n- We do have some indication of cost-effectiveness, and it naively seems like it may be competitive with the Gold Standard\n",
