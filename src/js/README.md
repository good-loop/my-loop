This folder holds the code for the portal -- served from `web-portal`
`app.jsx` is the entry point

It also holds code for the standalone advert viewer -- where Facebook & Twitter users see shared adverts -- served from `web-as`.
`as-app.js` is the entry point for that.

It is needed on the server!
Webpack then creates the compiled files there on the server.
