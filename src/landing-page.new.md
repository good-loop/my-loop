## Help Us Change Advertising For Good

### What do we do?
### And where can you see it?

WE DO ETHICAL ADS
YOU CAN SEE THESE ON WEBSITES
AND ON SOCIAL MEDIA CHANNELS
Our ads convert ad money into free charity donations,whilst delivering higher ad performance for the brands.

### How can you recognize our ads?

GOOD-LOOP LOGO
OUR LOGO IS THE FAIRTRADESTAMP OF ADVERTISING
Whenever you see our logo we guarantee that 50% of the cost of the ad will be donated to good causes.

### How these ads work?And where is the money coming from?

WE DONATE 50%
YOU PICK THE CHARITY, WE SEND THE MONEY
A single Good-loop ad can support up to 3 charities. When there is more than one charity displayed, you get to choose which one gets the money.
BRANDS PAYING MORE
FOR BETTER AD PERFORMANCE
Advertisers/brands pay for the donations. Why? Because in exchange they get a much higher ad engagement and increase in positive brand sentiment.

### How is the money split between charities?
EVERYONE GETS SOMETHING
BUT IT ALL DEPENDS ON YOU
The 50% of the ad money is split between the charities according to the number of votes they get from you, the ad viewer.

### Let’s save the world!
